Welcome to the FAQ section of the SSH Open Marketplace. Here you can find the most asked questions
and their answers. This page will be updated regularly to address the most frequently asked
questions.

- **How can I contribute to the SSH Open Marketplace?**

  The SSH Open Marketplace is a collaborative service, to which any user can contribute, creating
  new entries in the catalogue or enriching existing ones. You can also let us know what you would
  like to add or report a bug using the Report an issue function which is available on each page.
  All the ways to contribute are explained in
  [this dedicated section of the website](/contribute/overview).
- **Why do you promote commercial software?**

  The SSH Open Marketplace promotes any tools and services used by the SSH research communities. Our
  goal is to encourage the uptake of open methods, but we choose to also showcase the reality of
  existing research practices and this includes commercial software. We are not affiliated to or
  receiving any revenues from the commercial software referenced in this website.
- **Is the SSH Open Marketplace multilingual?**

  For the sake of simplicity the SSH Open Marketplace comes (for the moment) with an English user
  interface. Furthermore, the majority of the records are in English. However, the service
  encourages the addition of records in other European languages.
- **As a researcher in Social Sciences and Humanities, why should I contribute to the SSH Open
  Marketplace?**

  Because this is an opportunity to promote your own work - by adding the tools or training
  materials you've created as items in the Marketplace - or to support the uptake of the tools you
  use in your work on a daily basis - by creating or enriching the records of the resources you are
  familiar with.
- **Can I upload data to the SSH Open Marketplace?**

  As a simple answer: no. The SSH Open Marketplace is a discovery portal for tools & services,
  training materials, datasets, publications and workflows, not a research data repository. To find
  suitable research data repositories for your research data we advise that you consult established
  services like [re3data](https://www.re3data.org/).
- **What is the difference between the SSH Open Marketplace and the [EOSC Marketplace](https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/)? Where should I put my service?**Â 

  The SSH Open Marketplace is geared towards the social sciences and humanities, whereas EOSC is for all sciences. As such, the requirements are more strict to enter the EOSC Marketplace. In general, EOSC Marketplace entries are mature, high TRL (Technological Readiness Level) services and are onboarded by the institutional entity responsible for their development and maintenance. Entries on the SSH Open Marketplace are, above all, more focused on social sciences and humanities, which permits us to be more flexible in accepting tools and services still in development. As well, the contextualisation of the SSH Open Marketplace is another difference. Finally, know that all SSH related tools in the EOSC Marketplace are automatically ingested in the SSH Open Marketplace, so there is no need to worry about double posting.
