## Types of content

There are 5 main content types on the SSH Open Marketplace, which are considered to be representative for the large array of digital resources that can be found on this discovery platform.

![Tool or service](/assets/images/categories/tool-or-service.svg)

<div>

**Tools & services**

This type of content refers to all sorts of digital services or products, such as software, applications, programs, websites, programming libraries and APIs, that make tasks easier to execute. 
Some of them can be accessed directly in web browsers whereas others have to be installed locally.
_Examples:_ (1) The _[Gephi](/tool-or-service/87wJWo)_ tool is a visualisation and exploration software for all kinds of graphs and networks. (2) The _[DARIAH-DE Helpdesk (CLARIAH-DE, Text+)](/tool-or-service/riBkMh)_ is a service whose team is familiar with the humanities and cultural science research processes and may likely help you along with questions falling not directly into the services/resources of the mentioned initiatives.

![Training Material](/assets/images/categories/training-material.svg)

<div>

**Training materials**

Tutorials, lessons or didactic resources explaining how to perform an action or highlighting the
potential learning outcomes gained from using that material.

_Examples:_ (1) The lesson _[Cleaning Data with OpenRefine](/training-material/oaQM1D)_ which allows you to learn the principles and practice of data cleaning and how to use the OpenRefine tool. (2) The _[SSHOC Webinar: CLARIN Hands-on Tutorial on Transcribing Interview Data](/training-material/ITNpCC)_ which focuses on the role of automatic speech recognition – what are the opportunities, what are the pitfalls and to where can it be applied successfully.

![Workflow](/assets/images/categories/workflow.svg)

<div>

**Workflows**

Sequences of steps that one can perform on research data during their lifecycle. Workflows can be achieved by using diverse tools, resources  and methods, and the useful resources are connected to each step.

_Examples:_ (1) _[Extract textual content from images](/workflow/qYzKVU)_ is a workflow composed of 13 steps coming from the Standardization Survival Kit useful for extracting textual content from images. (2) _[Intertextuality phenomena in European drama history](/workflow/DMJlzG)_ is a workflow composed of 4 steps useful for analysing the relationships between the characters in a drama based on monologue/dialogue.

![Dataset](/assets/images/categories/dataset.svg)

<div>

**Datasets**

A dataset is an organised collection of data. It is generally associated with a unique body of work, typically covers one topic at a time and is treated as a single unit by a computer.

_Examples:_ (1) _[Parlamint](/dataset/9LlGMD)_ contains a collection of parliamentary datasets (corpora) in a number of languages and in a harmonized format that are processed linguistically, and indexed with popular concordancers.  (2) _[CoFiF-Corpus for Finance](/dataset/2AWjuo)_ is the first corpus comprising company reports in French; the documents are collected from the 60 largest French companies listed in France’s main stock indices CAC40 and CAC Next 20.

![Publication](/assets/images/categories/publication.svg)

<div>

**Publications**

Research results published in academic journals or non-peer-reviewed publication repositories such as Zenodo (our logic being that not all valuable academic production is necessarily in a traditional, peer-reviewed academic journal). The SSH Open Marketplace references **only** publications that can be connected to other resources (i.e. tools and services, training materials, workflows or datasets). As such, the SSH Open Marketplace is not an exhaustive collection of papers.

_Examples:_ (1) _[PoetryLab. An Open Source Toolkit for the Analysis of Spanish Poetry Corpora](/publication/aIYrN0)_ is a conference paper presented during the DH2020 Conference in which you can find an example of use of the SpaCy library (referenced as a tool in the SSH Open Marketplace). (2) _[Music Encoding Initiative Guidelines](/publication/8DmQJ6)_ are intended to serve as a reference tool for music encoders, and are linked to several workflows and related tools in the Marketplace.

## Inclusion criteria for adding resources: 4 questions to ask

In order to have high quality and high relevance content in the SSH Open Marketplace, we have established inclusion criteria for entry into the discovery platform. These apply both to individual items added manually by users, as well as to mass ingestions of entire sources (more on that below). 

Here is a list of four questions to ask before adding a resource on the SSH Open Marketplace and the ensuing inclusion criteria: 

1. The **relevance** of the resource. The question to ask is : _will this resource be relevant to the SSH scientific community?_ Thus, to be selected, any resource must fulfil at least two criteria: (1) scientific relevance and usefulness for SSH research and researchers and (2) pertinence to the digital methodologies used within the SSH landscape.
2. The **technical status** of the resource. The question to ask is: _is the resource current, supported, and ideally open?_ The SSH Open Marketplace favours the uptake of Open Science workflows and open research practices. Software resources are preferably built upon open source solutions.\
   Note: Given that the SSH Open Marketplace seeks to mirror actual research practices, commercial or non-current resources are also referenced where these are relevant for the scientific community.
3. The **degree of compliance with Open Science** requirements of the resource. The question to ask is: _is the resource FAIR – Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable - or contributing to the uptake of Open Science best practices?_ The SSH Open Marketplace maximises the findability and re-use of data, and guides users towards tools, services or training materials that can help them in their FAIRification of workflows.
4. The **uniqueness** of the resource The question to ask is: _is the resource already in the Marketplace?_ If yes, there is no need to add it again, either as an individual item or with a source. Even though duplicate entries are dealt with within the Marketplace, ingesting identical (or worse almost identical) entries multiple times uses up valuable human resources that will be better put to use elsewhere considering the limited timeframe and personnel of the project

## SSH Open Marketplace Core Principles



1. **Contextualization** is one of the key pillars of the SSH Open Marketplace. It is meant to provide a discovery portal for tools and services, while placing these tools and services in context via publications, training materials, datasets, and workflows. As such, these last four categories are indexed in the SSH Open Marketplace insofar as they can be placed in relation with tools and services, and if no relation to a tool or service exists, they should not be accepted. 
2. **Curation** is, alongside contextualization, a key pillar of the SSH Open Marketplace. We believe that accurate and up-to-date content is key to making the SSH Open Marketplace a rich and useful discovery portal. As such, data population and curation are at the heart of our work. Once (meta)data have been ingested in the Marketplace, we curate and enrich them thanks to a hybrid approach: automated checks are run on the ingested data, followed by manual review of the identified problems as well as of aspects that cannot be checked automatically. In this process, contributors and moderators are playing an essential role (See “How to contribute”). 
3. **Quality of the (meta)data**: higher quality data will increase the quality of the Marketplace. This means that the more of the metadata fields in the Marketplace data model are covered by an item, the better (items with just a title and a link are inferior to ones containing a long description and maybe even a list of contributors) and the more good quality metadata in your item or source, the higher the overall quality of the item or source. _Note_: currently, most publications lack metadata. This is a temporary situation, which is due to the fact that they were automatically ingested with the purpose to automatically identify relations with the other types of resources included in the SSH Open Marketplace. 
4. **Focus on primary sources:** in the Marketplace, we give priority to primary sources and exclude sources that only aggregate information that can be found elsewhere. Such “2nd hand metadata” introduces additional points of failure and using the primary source instead will likely result in higher quality metadata.
5. The **technical interface**: it is easier to import a source into the Marketplace if it offers a well-documented API. Considering the limited human resources of the team, sources which needed a lot of additional work before they could be fed into the ingestion pipeline are placed very low on the priority list.

## Sources

During the development phase of the SSH Open Marketplace, we identified and prioritised **trusted
sources** (i.e compliant with the Core Principles defined above) from which to gather information to populate the SSH Open Marketplace. Over the 3 years of
the SSHOC project, 15 sources have been ingested for a total of over 5,000 individual items. The
sources are listed below.

The [CLARIN Resource Families](https://www.clarin.eu/resource-families) are a number of curated
collections of corpora and tools. They are manually put together by CLARIN with the aim to provide a
user-friendly overview of existing resources within and without the CLARIN infrastructure.

![DARIAH-Campus](/assets/cms/images/campus.png)

[DARIAH-Campus](https://campus.dariah.eu/) is both a discovery framework and a hosting platform for
DARIAH and DARIAH-affiliated training and education materials.

![DARIAH Contribution Tool](/assets/cms/images/ikct.png)

DARIAH member states contribute to the DARIAH distributed infrastructure with a diverse range of
resources and services, and declare these in-kind contributions via the
[DARIAH contribution tool](https://contrib.dariah.eu/). A selected set of these contributions has
been added to the SSH Open Marketplace.

![SSHOC logo](/assets/cms/images/sshoc.png)

The [SSHOC service catalogue](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/service-catalogue) is the result of all
SSHOC Work Packages to collect and consolidate the SSHOC services (or resources) offered. Based on
the progressing implementation of the project, resources referenced in the catalogue are the most
visible outputs of the SSHOC project.

![SSHOC Conversion Hub](/assets/cms/images/conversionhub.png)

The [SSH Conversion Hub is an outcome of SSHOC WP3](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5561604). It
allows users to search for tools that convert from one (meta-)data/file format to another one, e.g.
from CSV (comma-separated values) to TEI (Text Encoding Initiative). import withHeadingIds from
'remark-slug'

![SSH Training Discovery Toolkit](/assets/cms/images/tdt.png)

The [SSH Training Discovery Toolkit](https://training-toolkit.sshopencloud.eu) acts as an overview
on relevant sources that hold (digital) material for trainers. For such sources, selected items are
described in more detail than is useful for the SSH community and give a hint about what training
material to expect from the source.

</div>

If you don't see some of these sources in the Marketplace, it is because they are still in the
process of being ingested. New sources are also regularly added (between 1 to 2 sources per year). As there are some criteria to comply with, please
[check the Contribute section](/contribute/overview) if you would like to suggest new sources.
