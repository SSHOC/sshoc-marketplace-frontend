The SSH Open Marketplace was created with funding from the [SSHOC project](/about/sshoc-eosc). After the end of the project, 3 ERICs and some of their national nodes decided to ensure the sustainability of the SSH Open Marketplace, under the umbrella of the SSH Open Cluster. They act as a **Governing Board** for the SSH Open Marketplace and define the Marketplace strategic policy with regards to scientific, technical and managerial matters.

Two institutions act as service providers on behalf of these ERICs: the [Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH)](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences providing hosting and maintenance for the service, and the P[oznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PSNC)](https://www.psnc.pl/) affiliated to the Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Polish Academy of Sciences providing the data ingestion pipeline as well as hosting and maintenance for the service.



## Editorial team

An **Editorial Team** ensures the day-to-day maintenance and the data quality of the SSH Open Marketplace. The Editorial Team, liaising with the service providers and the end-users of the service (SSH researchers and support staff for researchers) ensures the technical running of operation, the effectiveness of the curation process and the editorial policy's successful implementation.

Since the 1st of May 2022, 8 members have been appointed by the Governing Board. They were joined, in September 2022, by 9 volunteers.
