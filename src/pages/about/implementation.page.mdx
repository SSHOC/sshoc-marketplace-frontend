## Data model

The data model of the SSH Open Marketplace was designed to be generic and flexible enough to support
a variety of sources. The data model v1.5 is presented in the
[Marketplace â€“ Implementation report](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5749464).

## Data ingestion workflow

The SSH Open Marketplace provides a REST API at the backend where data can not only be read but also
inserted or updated. This approach allows technology-agnostic ingestion. During the development
phase, two main ingestion pipelines - covering the gathering of the data at the source (e.g. via an
API or a Git repository), the mapping of the data to the SSH Open Marketplace data model including
transformation of parts of the data (e.g. connecting terms from the source to a vocabulary like
TaDiRAH) and the integration of the processed data into the SSH Open Marketplace via the API - were
used:

- [PoolParty UnifiedViews](https://www.poolparty.biz/agile-data-integration) provided by
  [Semantic Web Company (SWC)](https://semantic-web.com/).
- [Data Aggregation and proCessing Engine (DACE)](https://gitlab.pcss.pl/dl-team/aggregation/dace)
  developed by the Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PSNC)

## Information about the development of the website

The development of the SSH Open Marketplace is managed via GitHub. If you want to know more, pay a
visit to our GitHub organization: [https://github.com/SSHOC](https://github.com/SSHOC/)

## API documentation

The SSH Open Marketplace also includes an Application Programming Interface (API), which is opened
for anyone to use. Some of the functionalities are closed, but most are opened, such as searching
and retrieving detailed information on all items of the Marketplace.

You can inspect the API Swagger documentation here:
[https://marketplace-api.sshopencloud.eu/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/v3/api-docs](https://marketplace-api.sshopencloud.eu/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/v3/api-docs)

The endpoint of the SSH Open Marketplace API is:
[https://marketplace-api.sshopencloud.eu/api/](https://marketplace-api.sshopencloud.eu/api/)

The API responses are in JSON and follow the data model that we have created for the Marketplace
(see "Data model" section above).

For example, you can request a description of all the "tools and services" that the SSH Open
Marketplace provides at
[https://marketplace-api.sshopencloud.eu/api/tools-services](https://marketplace-api.sshopencloud.eu/api/tools-services)
and following pages
[https://marketplace-api.sshopencloud.eu/api/tools-services?page=2](https://marketplace-api.sshopencloud.eu/api/tools-services?page=2).

<ApiEndpoint title="Item search" endpoint={{ key: 'item-search', pathname: '/api/item-search' }}>
  <ApiParamTextField label="Search" param="q" placeholder="Search term" />

  <ApiParamSelect label="Page" param="page">
    <Item key={1}>Page 1</Item>
    <Item key={2}>Page 2</Item>
    <Item key={3}>Page 3</Item>
  </ApiParamSelect>
</ApiEndpoint>

The API also includes some endpoints that are only accessible to logged in users. To use them, you
need to ask for a JWT (JSON Web Token) to the authentication endpoint and then use the Token to
connect to the other endpoint, by passing the Token as a Bearer Authentication.

### Example

```
curl -i --request POST 'https://sshoc-marketplace-api.acdh-dev.oeaw.ac.at/api/auth/sign-in' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"username": "SomeUserName","password": "xxxxxxxx"}'
```

Will respond with a Token as such:

```
Authorization: Bearer xxxyyyyzzzhfdsklmgdflkngfdngdfklngfdfgdf,gfdngfndkljgn
```

And this is then used in the following requests to prove you are authenticated, for example:

```
curl -X DELETE 'https://sshoc-marketplace-api.acdh-dev.oeaw.ac.at/api/datasets/3752' --header 'Authorization: Bearer xxxyyyyzzzhfdsklmgdflkngfdngdfklngfdfgdf,gfdngfndkljgn'
```
