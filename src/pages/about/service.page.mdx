The Social Sciences and Humanities Open Marketplace, built as part of the
[Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud project (SSHOC)](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/), is a
discovery portal which pools and contextualises resources for Social Sciences and Humanities
research communities: **tools, services, training materials, datasets, publications and workflows**.
The Marketplace highlights and showcases solutions and research practices for every step of the SSH
research data life cycle.

The SSH Open Marketplace is:

- a **discovery portal**, to foster serendipity in digital methods
- an **aggregator** of useful and well curated resources
- a **catalogue**, contextualising resources
- an **entry point in the EOSC** for the Social Sciences and Humanities researchers

The SSH Open Marketplace is _not_:

- a repository. Nothing is hosted in the SSH Open Marketplace. Workflow content type can be hosted,
  but this is an exception
- a data catalogue. The goal is not to collect all the SSH datasets, but selected datasets are
  indexed to support the contextualisation (dataset mentioned in a publication or used in a training
  material for example).
- a commercial Marketplace. There is nothing to sell in the SSH Open Marketplace. Commercial
  software/services can be referenced.
