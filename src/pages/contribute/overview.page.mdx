The Social Sciences and Humanities Open Marketplace needs you! The SSH Open Marketplace is the
result of collective and collaborative efforts and you are very welcome to contribute. You will find
on these pages a summary of the different ways you can get involved.

**As a visitor** of the SSH Open Marketplace, and without any account, you can
[report an issue](/contact), leave a comment or
[reach out to the SSH Open Marketplace Editorial Team](/about/team). Help us to improve the service,
or just let us know what you think or how we can help. We are always happy to get in touch with
curious visitors or new comers!

**As a contributor**, you can help us to improve the SSH Open Marketplace data/content. There are
two main ways you can help us make the Marketplace better for researchers just like you. FIrstly,
you can improve the quality of existing records by suggesting edits. As well, you can add entirely
new items to the Marketplace, either by directly suggesting an entirely new entry, or by proposing a
source for mass ingestion. All you need to know for these contributions is explained in these pages:

1.  You would like to improve an item you've found on the SSH Open Marketplace, to add a relation
    between two (or more) items, just get in and follow our recommendations to
    [edit and enrich existing items](/contribute/enrich-an-individual-item)
2.  You have noticed that your favorite tool or training material is not referenced in the SSH Open
    Marketplace and you would like to add it, follow our guidelines to
    [create an individual item](/contribute/create-an-individual-item)
3.  The mass ingests are managed by the Editorial Team, but you can
    [Suggest a new source](/about/data#inclusion-criteria)

As a **moderator** or **administrator**, you are a member of the [Editorial Team](/about/team), and
you have some missions to ensure the SSH Open Marketplace quality. The
[moderator guidelines](/contribute/moderator-guidelines) and the
[administrator guidelines](/contribute/administrator-guidelines) are the public documentation
providing an overview of these missions. Are you interested in joining the editorial team? Get in
touch with us!
