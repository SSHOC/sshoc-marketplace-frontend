If you find an existing Marketplace entry that you wish to enhance or correct, you can do so via the
edit forms. To access this, log in to your Marketplace account and go to the item you wish to
correct. Above the entry, in blue, you will find an "Edit" button, which will open up a page where
you can fill in the information.

If you need some explanation or examples for some of the metadata fields, please consult the
["Guidance for metadata fields" table](/contribute/metadata-guidelines#guidance-for-metadata-fields).

You may save your edits as a draft, without making a final submission, by using the Save as Draft
button. Once you have finished, click "Publish" and it will go to review for our moderation team.
Via the "My account" dashboard, you can access your contributed and draft items.

We encourage members of our community to continue to update and enrich Marketplace entries, as
digital tools, workflows, and datasets useful in social sciences and humanities are rapidly
changing. We are relying on you to help us maintain this information as up to date as possible for
the scholarly community.
