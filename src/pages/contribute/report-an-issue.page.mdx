Any issue you find browsing the Marketplace and you don't want to or can't correct on your own may
be signaled with our report an issue function. Through [this form](/contact?subject=Report+an+issue)
the issue reaches the attention of the editorial team. If you have a question or if you are
interested in curating more items of the Marketplace or if you have a source with a larger quantity
of records, you may indicate this also via the form.
