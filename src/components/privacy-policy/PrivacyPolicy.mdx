## Privacy Policy

This privacy statement describes how the SSH Open Marketplace collects and uses data while browsing
this website or using our API. We are committed to ensuring that your personal details are protected
when you use our website, or API. If you have any questions about how we use your personal
information or comply with data protection legislation, please [contact us](/contact).

### What information do we collect?

- **Analytics** – We use [Matomo Analytics](https://matomo.org/) to measure the use of the SSH Open
  Marketplace. It collects data about your activities which do not personally or directly identify
  you when you visit our website. This information may include content you view, the date and time
  you viewed the content, or your location information associated with your IP address. The SSH Open
  Marketplace uses this information to improve the structure and content of our website.
- **Contact and login details** – We collect contact information for the user accounts, name and
  email address of the logged users. This information is either provided directly by the user, or
  after their acknowledgment via their Identity Provider (IdP) used in the Authentication and
  Authorization Infrastructure (AAI).

### How do we use this information?

The analytics information retrieved helps in improving the website, or getting usage data at a very
generic level. The login information is used to manage access to the admin site.

### Will the SSH Open Marketplace share your personal details with anyone else?

We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless disclosure
is required by law. If you feel that this site is not following its stated privacy policy, please
contact us. We will be sure to address your concerns.

## Copyright notice

- **License for source code** – The license for the source code of the SSH Open Marketplace is
  Apache License 2.0. More information about this license can be found
  [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/).
- **License for content** – This website collects its content from various sources with different
  reuse policies. Most of the time, catalogues where metadata were collected presented clear
  licences and you can always find information on sources on every item of our catalogue.

Contributors and Moderators of the SSH Open Marketplace enrich the metadata, add new information and
links to it.

We are currently looking for the best licensing framework to support our model: we aim to ensure
wide distribution and reuse of our data, and to avoid attribution stacking or license stacking, but
we do consider attribution to be an essential information to be provided by data aggregators. This
section of our website will be updated accordingly.
