If you find an existing Marketplace entry that you wish to enhance or correct, you can do so via the edit forms. It is very easy and straightforward to suggest editions to an item. Here is a 4 steps approach explaining you how to proceed!

## 1. Log in

First, you need to sign in to the SSH Open Marketplace which should be possible very conveniently using already existing credentials (academic or social accounts are available).

![Sign in the SSH Open Marketplace step 3](/assets/cms/images/sign-in-mai-3.png)

**If it is your first log in** to the Marketplace, you will have to undergo several validation steps before being logged in. This is normal.

You need to accept the Usage Policies, as shown in the two screens below:

Your account is now successfully connected to the Marketplace, and you can go back to the [sign in page of the SSH Open Marketplace](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/auth/sign-in).

If you encounter any problem with logging in, or do not find your history of contributed items in your account, please get in touch with the team using the \[contact form](/contact) or directly via [sshopenmarketplace@sshopencloud.eu](sshopenmarketplace@sshopencloud.eu).

## 2. Go to the item you wish to correct

## 3. Edit the entry

When clicking on the "Edit" button, you land on the edit form, where existing information are already filled in. You can modify/delete them and add new information too.

See "Fill in the form" step of the previous section for more details and guided examples. The full metadata guidelines are also available here.

You may save your edits as a draft, without making a final submission, by using the Save as Draft button. Once you have finished, click "Publish" and it will go to review for our moderation team. Via the "My account" dashboard, you can access your contributed and draft items.

4. #### **Submit your changes for moderation**

What happens next?

Once you click on the "suggest/submit" button, your item is sent to moderators (i.e a members of the Editorial Board) for review. Moderators will accept or reject your changes. In case of rejection or additional questions, a moderator will get in touch with you.

Once accepted, a new version of the item you have contributed to is published on the SSH Open Marketplace. You and other contributors can still edit the entry following the same 4 steps as described here.

If you need some explanation or examples for some of the metadata fields, please consult the
["Guidance for metadata fields" table](/contribute/metadata-guidelines#guidance-for-metadata-fields).
