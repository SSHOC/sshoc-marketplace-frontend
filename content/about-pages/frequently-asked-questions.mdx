Welcome to the FAQ section of the SSH Open Marketplace. Here you can find the most asked questions and their answers. This page will be updated regularly to address the most frequently asked questions.  


* **How can I contribute to the SSH Open Marketplace?**

The SSH Open Marketplace is a collaborative service, to which any user can contribute, creating new entries in the catalogue or enriching existing ones. You can also let us know what you would like to add or report a bug using the Report an issue function which is available on each page. All the ways to contribute are explained in [this dedicated section of the website](/contribute/overview).   

* **Why do you promote commercial software?**

The SSH Open Marketplace promotes any tools and services used by the SSH research communities. Our goal is to encourage the uptake of open methods, but we choose to also showcase the reality of existing research practices and this includes commercial software. We are not affiliated to or receiving any revenues from the commercial software referenced in this website.

* **What is the preferred granularity for resources showcased (i.e. if a training material is part of a five-chapter lesson, which entry/pointer should be used to record this resource on the SSH Open Marketplace)?**

Each record should come with as much detail as is useful for the user. 


* **Is the SSH Open Marketplace multilingual?**

For the sake of simplicity the SSH Open Marketplace comes (for the moment) with an English user interface. Furthermore, the majority of the records are in English. However, the service encourages the addition of records in other European languages. 

* ** As a researcher in Social Sciences and Humanities, why should I contribute to the SSH Open Marketplace?  **

Because this is an opportunity to promote your own work - by adding the tools or training materials youâ€™ve created as items in the Marketplace -  or to support the uptake of the tools you use in your work on a daily basis - by creating or enriching the records of the resources you are familiar with.

The SSH Open Marketplace is one of the disciplinary information hubs for relevant SSH tools & services, training materials, datasets, publications and workflows. The SSH Open Marketplace tries to be as inclusive as possible and encourages a strong community curation. However, a record should not be added twice or more in different information hubs, especially within the EOSC environment. To address this issue of unnecessary duplication of work and interoperability, the SSH Open Marketplace makes use of automated exchange processes with other platforms such as the EOSC Catalogue & Marketplace. 

* **Can I upload data to the SSH Open Marketplace?**

As a simple answer: no. The SSH Open Marketplace is a discovery portal for  tools & services, training materials, datasets, publications and workflows, not a research data repository. To find suitable research data repositories for your research data we advise that you consult established services like [re3data](https://www.re3data.org/).
