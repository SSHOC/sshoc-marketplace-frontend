## Sources

During the development phase of the SSH Open Marketplace, we identified and prioritised **trusted
sources** from which to gather information to populate the SSH Open Marketplace. Over the 3 years of
the SSHOC project, 15 sources have been ingested for a total of over 5,000 individual items. The
sources are listed below.

<div className="grid gap-y-4 grid-cols-[100px_1fr] xs:grid-cols-[150px_1fr] gap-x-4">

DARIAH member states contribute to the DARIAH distributed infrastructure with a diverse range of
resources and services, and declare these in-kind contributions via the
[DARIAH contribution tool](https://contrib.dariah.eu/). A selected set of these contributions has
been added to the SSH Open Marketplace.

![SSHOC logo](/assets/images/sshoc.png "SSHOC logo")

The [SSHOC service catalogue](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/service-catalogue) is the result of all
SSHOC Work Packages to collect and consolidate the SSHOC services (or resources) offered. Based on
the progressing implementation of the project, resources referenced in the catalogue are the most
visible outputs of the SSHOC project.

The [SSH Conversion Hub is an outcome of SSHOC WP3](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5561604). It
allows users to search for tools that convert from one (meta-)data/file format to another one, e.g.
from CSV (comma-separated values) to TEI (Text Encoding Initiative). import withHeadingIds from
'remark-slug'

![SSH Training Discovery Toolkit](/assets/images/tdt.png "SSH Training Discovery Toolkit")

The [SSH Training Discovery Toolkit](https://training-toolkit.sshopencloud.eu) acts as an overview
on relevant sources that hold (digital) material for trainers. For such sources, selected items are
described in more detail than is useful for the SSH community and give a hint about what training
material to expect from the source.

</div>

If you don't see some of these sources in the Marketplace, it is because they are still in the
process of being ingested. New sources will also be regularly added. Between 1 to 4 sources per year
are expected starting mid-2022. As there are a few criteria to comply with, please
[check the Contribute section](/contribute/overview) if you would like to suggest new sources.

## Types of content

The conceptual approach used to structure and classify the content of the SSH Open Marketplace led
to the identification of 5 main content types.

<div className="grid gap-y-4 grid-cols-[60px_1fr] gap-x-4">

![Tool or service](/assets/images/categories/tool-or-service.svg "Tool or service logo")

<div>

### Tools & services

Materials or products used to perform activities such as:

- Desktop clients solutions (to be installed locally)
- Browser-based or command-line based resources
- Mobile apps
- Programming libraries or APIs
- Data catalogues

_Example:_ [Gephi](/tool-or-service/87wJWo) is a visualisation and exploration software for all
kinds of graphs and networks.

</div>
</div>

<div className="grid gap-y-4 grid-cols-[60px_1fr] gap-x-4">

![Training Material](/assets/images/categories/training-material.svg "Training Material")

<div>

### Training materials

Tutorials, lessons or didactic resources explaining how to perform an action or highlighting the
learning outcomes one would gain from engaging with the material.

_Example:_ The [lesson "Beginner's Guide to Twitter Data"](/training-material/7dimO5) (Programming
Historian website).

</div>
</div>

<div className="grid gap-y-4 grid-cols-[60px_1fr] gap-x-4">

![Workflow](/assets/images/categories/workflow.svg "Workflow logo")

<div>

### Workflows

Sequences of operation/steps performed on research data during their lifecycle. Workflows can be
achieved by using diverse tools and facilities, and useful resources are connected to each step.

_Example:_ ["Extract textual content from images"](/workflow/qYzKVU) is a workflow composed of 13
steps coming from the Standardization Survival Kit.

</div>

<div className="grid gap-y-4 grid-cols-[60px_1fr] gap-x-4">

![Dataset](/assets/images/categories/dataset.svg "Dataset logo")

<div>

### Datasets

Single digital objects or collections of data, records, or information that is kept as a persistent
unit of information in the knowledge generation process. Datasets are used as evidence for some
phenomena.

_Example:_ [Parlamint 2.0](/dataset/9LlGMD)

</div>

<div className="grid gap-y-4 grid-cols-[60px_1fr] gap-x-4">

![Publication](/assets/images/categories/publication.svg "Publication logo")

<div>

### Publications

Research results published in academic journals or repositories. The SSH Open Marketplace references
only publications that can be connected to other resources and is not an exhaustive collection of
papers.

_Example:_
["PoetryLab. An Open Source Toolkit for the Analysis of Spanish Poetry Corpora"](/publication/aIYrN0)
is a Conference Paper presented during the DH2020 Conference in which you can find an example of use
of the SpaCy library (referenced as a tool in the SSH Open Marketplace).

## Inclusion criteria

In order to ensure high quality data in the SSH Open Marketplace, we have established inclusion
criteria for entry into the database. These apply to both individual items, as well as mass
ingestions of entire sources (more on that below).

The Marketplace comes with a good coverage of resources relevant to academics, scholars and students
from the Social Sciences and Humanities but research is dynamic and you may point us to new and
upcoming items, or even entire collections of resources. You may suggest such collections as new
sources to the Marketplace. import withHeadingIds from 'remark-slug' An item or source has to match
the following selection criteria:

- The **relevance of the data**: Above all, the **SSH Open Marketplace serves researchers in the
  social sciences and the humanities**, therefore, there must be an established link between the
  content added into the Marketplace and the SSH. The broad scope of the SSH Open Marketplace means
  that to be selected, any resource must fulfill at least two criteria: (1) relevance for SSH
  research and researchers and (2) pertinence to the digital methodologies used within the SSH
  landscape.
- From a technical point of view, **the data must also be current, supported, and ideally open**.
  The SSH Open Marketplace favours the uptake of Open Science workflows and open research practices.
  Software resources are preferably built upon open source solutions. Note: Given that the SSH Open
  Marketplace seeks to mirror actual research practices, commercial or non-current resources are
  also referenced where these are relevant for the scientific community.
- **Contextualization** is one of the key pillars of the SSH Open Marketplace. It is meant to
  provide a discovery portal for tools and services, while placing these tools and services in
  context via publications, training materials, datasets, and workflows. As such, these last four
  categories are indexed in the SSH Open Marketplace insofar as they can be placed in relation with
  tools and services, and if no relation to a tool or service exists, they should not be accepted.
- the **quality of the (meta)data**: higher quality data will increase the quality of the
  Marketplace; this means that the more of the metadata fields in the Marketplace data model are
  covered by an item, the better (items with just a title and a link are inferior to ones containing
  a long description and maybe even a list of contributors) and the more good quality metadata in
  your item or source , the higher the overall quality of the item or source.
- the **uniqueness of the data**: if the data is already in the Marketplace, there is no need to add
  it again, either as an individual item or with a source. Even though duplicate entries are dealt
  with within the Marketplace, ingesting identical (or worse almost identical) entries multiple
  times uses up valuable human resources that will be better put to use elsewhere considering the
  limited timeframe and personnel of the project
- the **expected usefulness** for the SSH community: are the items in this source possibly of use to
  SSH researchers; it could be that they are widely used already or that they offer new and
  interesting possibilities
- the **representativity** of the source for the SSH domain: with the various partners in the SSHOC
  project coming from different parts of the wide field of SSH (e.g. CESSDA being mostly concerned
  with social sciences, while CLARIN is more linguistics/language focused), considerable effort was
  made to find sources that represent all the different facets of the SSH landscape; it also made
  sense to prioritize sources coming from the SSHOC project itself, assuming that they will have
  this kind of representativity baked in already.
- Finally, in terms of legal and ethical requirements, the SSH Open Marketplace maximises the
  findability and re-use of data in line with the **FAIR data principles** – Findable, Accessible,
  Interoperable and Re-usable – for research data, and guides users towards tools, services or
  training materials that can help them in their FAIRification of workflows. Of necessity, the SSH
  Open Marketplace is GDPR compliant. This is reflected in the manner of presentation of the
  resources and – more obviously – in the management of users.

Additionally, when suggesting a source for the Marketplace, please keep in mind the following
additional criteria:

- the **technical interface**: it is easier to import a source into the Marketplace if it offers a
  well-documented API; considering the limited human resources of the project, sources which needed
  a lot of additional work before they could be fed into the ingestion pipeline were placed very low
  on the priority list
- It was decided to focus on **primary sources** and exclude sources that only aggregate information
  that can be found elsewhere; such “2nd hand metadata” introduces additional points of failure and
  using the primary source instead will likely result in higher quality metadata

We believe that accurate and up-to-date content is key to making the SSH Open Marketplace a rich and
useful discovery portal, data population and curation are at the heart of our work. Once (meta)data
have been ingested in the Marketplace, we curate and enrich them thanks to a hybrid approach:
automated checks are run on the ingested data, followed by manual review of the identified problems
as well as of aspects that cannot be checked automatically. In this process, contributors and
moderators are playing an essential role (See “How to contribute” below).
