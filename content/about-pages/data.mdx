## Sources

During the development phase of the SSH Open Marketplace, we identified and
prioritised **trusted sources** from which to gather information to populate the SSH Open Marketplace. Over the 3 years of the SSHOC project, 15 sources have been ingested for a total of over 5,000 individual items. The
sources are listed below.

Training materials produced as part of the [SSHOC training events](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/training/training-events). 

![SSHOC Conversion Hub](/assets/images/conversionhub.png "SSHOC Conversion Hub")

The [SSH Conversion Hub is an outcome of SSHOC WP3](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5561604). It allows users to search for tools that convert from one (meta-)data/file format to another one, e.g. from CSV (comma-separated values) to TEI (Text Encoding Initiative).

![SSH Training Discovery Toolkit](/assets/images/tdt.png "SSH Training Discovery Toolkit")

The [SSH Training Discovery Toolkit](https://training-toolkit.sshopencloud.eu) acts as an overview on relevant sources that hold (digital) material for trainers. For such sources, selected items are described in more detail than is useful for the SSH community and give a hint about what training material to expect from the source.

</div>

If you donâ€™t see some of these sources in the Marketplace, it is because they are still in the process of being ingested. New sources will also be regularly added. Between 1 to 4 sources per year are expected starting mid-2022. As there are a few criteria to comply with, please [check the Contribute section](/contribute/overview) if you would like to suggest new sources. 


## Types of content

The conceptual approach used to structure and classify the content of the SSH
Open Marketplace led to the identification of 5 main content types.

<div className="grid" style="grid-template-columns: 60px 1fr; column-gap: 1rem">

![Tool or service](/assets/images/categories/tool-or-service.svg "Tool or service logo")

<div>

### Tools & services

Materials or products used to perform activities such as:

* Desktop clients solutions (to be installed locally)
* Browser-based or command-line based resources
* Mobile apps
* Programming libraries or APIs
* Data catalogues

*Example:* [Gephi](/tool-or-service/87wJWo) is a visualisation and exploration software for all kinds of
graphs and networks.

</div>
</div>

<div className="grid" style="grid-template-columns: 60px 1fr; column-gap: 1rem">

![Training Material](/assets/images/categories/training-material.svg "Training Material")

<div>

### Training materials

Tutorials, lessons or didactic resources explaining how to perform an action or
highlighting the learning outcomes one would gain from engaging with the
material.

*Example:* The lesson "Beginner's Guide to Twitter Data" (Programming Historian
website).

</div>
</div>

<div className="grid" style="grid-template-columns: 60px 1fr; column-gap: 1rem">

![Workflow](/assets/images/categories/workflow.svg "Workflow logo")

<div>

### Workflows

Sequences of operation/steps performed on research data during their lifecycle.
Workflows can be achieved by using diverse tools and facilities, and useful
resources are connected to each step.

*Example:* ["Extract textual content from images"](/workflow/qYzKVU) is a workflow composed of 13
steps coming from the Standardization Survival Kit.

</div>
</div>

<div className="grid" style="grid-template-columns: 60px 1fr; column-gap: 1rem">

![Dataset](/assets/images/categories/dataset.svg "Dataset logo")

<div>

### Datasets

Single digital objects or collections of data, records, or information that is
kept as a persistent unit of information in the knowledge generation process.
Datasets are used as evidence for some phenomena.

*Example:* [Parlamint 2.0](/dataset/9LlGMD)

</div>

<div className="grid" style="grid-template-columns: 60px 1fr; column-gap: 1rem">

![Publication](/assets/images/categories/publication.svg "Publication logo")

<div>

### Publications

Research results published in academic journals or repositories. The SSH Open
Marketplace references only publications that can be connected to other
resources and is not an exhaustive collection of papers.

*Example:* ["PoetryLab. An Open Source Toolkit for the Analysis of Spanish Poetry
Corpora"](/publication/aIYrN0) is a Conference Paper presented during the DH2020 Conference in which
you can find an example of use of the SpaCy library (referenced as a tool in the
SSH Open Marketplace).

## Inclusion criteria

Because we believe that accurate and up-to-date content is key to making the SSH
Open Marketplace a rich and useful discovery portal, data population and
curation are at the heart of our work. Once (meta)data have been ingested in the
Marketplace, we curate and enrich them thanks to a hybrid approach: automatic
checks are run on the ingested data, followed by manual review of the identified
problems as well as of aspects that cannot be checked automatically. In this
process, contributors and moderators are playing an essential role (See "How to
contribute" below).

Currently the curation criteria fall into three categories.

1. **Scientific**

   The broad scope of the SSH Open Marketplace means that to be selected, any
   resource must fulfill at least two criteria:

   * Relevance for science and scientists
   * Pertinence to the digital methodologies used within the SSH landscape

   Selection decisions are made by Moderators. Particularly for resources such
   as technical services or software, the SSH link could be very loose. In such
   cases the relevance may be assessed in terms of the uptake or prominence of a
   resource within the SSH community.
2. **Technical**

   Ideally, two technical curation criteria should be met by any resource:

   * Current and supported
   * Open

   The SSH Open Marketplace favours the uptake of Open Science workflows and
   open research practices. Software resources are preferably built upon open
   source solutions.

   Note: Given that the SSH Open Marketplace seeks to mirror actual research
   practices, commercial or non-current resources are also referenced where
   these are relevant for the scientific community.
3. **Legal/Ethical**

   By design, the SSH Open Marketplace maximises the findability and re-use of
   data in line with the **FAIR principles** â€“ Findable, Accessible,
   Interoperable and Re-usable â€“ for research data, and guides users towards
   tools, services or training materials that can help them in their
   FAIRification workflows.

   Of necessity, the SSH Open Marketplace is GDPR compliant . This is reflected
   in the manner of presentation of the resources and â€“ more obviously â€“ in the
   management of users.
