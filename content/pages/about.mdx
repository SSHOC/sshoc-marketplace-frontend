title: What is the SSH Open Marketplace?
---

The Social Sciences and Humanities Open Marketplace, built as part of the
[Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud project (SSHOC)](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/),
is a discovery portal which pools and contextualises resources for Social
Sciences and Humanities research communities: tools, services, training
materials, datasets and activities (workflows and scenarios). The Marketplace
highlights and showcases solutions and research practices for every step of the
SSH research data life cycle.

## Key aspects

- **Curation** – This portal thrives on a curation process that makes it easy to
  discover the most appropriate results for each request, so that researchers
  can discover the best resources for the digital aspects of their work. The
  curation process relies on three components: automatic ingest and update of
  data sources; continuous curation of the information by the editorial team
  and - most important - contributions from its users, the SSH community.
- **Community** – The content available in the SSH Open Marketplace and its
  contextualisation is the result of collaborative work that is characterised by
  a user-centric view. Features that allow contributions, feedback and comments
  are implemented to ensure that the portal mirrors real research practices.
- **Contextualisation** – The portal puts all items into context. This
  contextualisation will help to adapt and reuse the content of the SSH Open
  Marketplace, no matter if they are a piece of software, a dataset, a research
  workflow or scientific article.

## Relation to EOSC

The SSH Open Marketplace is a Social Sciences and Humanities component for the
European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) since the SSHOC project, from which this
discovery portal is being constructed, is the SSH cluster of the EOSC. As a
domain oriented portal, it supplements the existing services offered by EOSC
(e.g. EOSC Catalogue & Marketplace) and aims to facilitate fluid exchange of
tools, services, data and knowledge.

## In development

The development of the portal takes place within Work Package 7 (WP7) of the
larger SSHOC project and is led by the DARIAH ERIC.

Three releases of this website are planed between June 2020 and December 2021:

- **June 2020**: alpha version of the website is available for testers
- **December 2020**: beta and public release
- **December 2021**: final release of the SSH Open Marketplace
