# What is the SSH Open Marketplace?

The Social Sciences and Humanities Open Marketplace, built as part of the
[Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud project (SSHOC)](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/),
is a discovery portal which pools and contextualises resources for Social
Sciences and Humanities research communities: tools, services, training
materials, datasets, publications and workflows. The Marketplace highlights and showcases
solutions and research practices for every step of the SSH research data life
cycle.

Three key aspects have been guiding the development of the SSH Open Marketplace.

* **Curation** – This portal thrives on a curation process that makes it easy to
  discover the most appropriate results for each request, so that researchers
  can discover the best resources for the digital aspects of their work. The
  curation process relies on three components: automatic ingest and update of
  data sources; continuous curation of the information by the editorial team and
  – most important – contributions from users, the SSH research community.
* **Community** – The content available in the SSH Open Marketplace and its
  contextualisation is the result of collaborative work that is characterised by
  a user-centric approach. Features that allow contributions, feedback and
  comments are implemented – or will be soon – to ensure that the portal mirrors
  real research practices.
* **Contextualisation** – The portal puts all items into context: each solution
  suggested is linked to other related resources (e.g. a tutorial showing how to
  use a tool, a tool used in a workflow, a publication presenting research
  results produced using a given service). This contextualisation enhances the
  usefulness of the SSH Open Marketplace and ensures users  receive the maximum
  possible benefit from all its contents.

## A Thematic Contribution to the European Open Science Cloud

The creation of the SSH Open Marketplace was funded by the [Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud (SSHOC) project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/823782) which supported the integration and consolidation of thematic e-infrastructure platforms in preparation for connecting them to the [European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://sshopencloud.eu/sshoc-eosc). The overall objective of the SSHOC project was to realise the Social Sciences and Humanities part of EOSC.

As a domain-oriented discovery portal and the aggregator of the SSHOC project, the SSH Open Marketplace, contributes directly to the EOSC, supplementing  existing services such as the EOSC Catalogue & Marketplace, and facilitating the fluid exchange of tools, services, data, and knowledge.

## Governance & sustainability

After the end of the SSHOC project, 3 ERICs and some of their national nodes will ensure the sustainability of the  SSH Open Marketplace. They act as a **Governing Board** for the SSH Open Marketplace and define the Marketplace strategic policy with regards to scientific, technical and managerial matters.

An **Editorial Team** ensures the day-to-day maintenance and the data quality of the SSH Open Marketplace. The Editorial Team, liaising with the service providers and the end-users of the service (SSH researchers and support staff for researchers) ensures the technical running of operation, the effectiveness of the curation process and the editorial policy’s successful implementation. 

## Main functionalities

Using the SSH Open Marketplace, you can:

* Search the resources, refining your query through faceted search. 
  ![screenshot search resources](/assets/images/search-refine-screenshot.png "screenshot search resources")
* Browse the content by activities or keywords
  ![browsing screenshot](/assets/images/browse_activities_screenshot.png "browsing screenshot")
* Obtain a detailed view of every item registered in the website, including a
  structured set of metadata describing the resource, and highlighting the
  related items to facilitate the discovery of relevant resources
  ![detailed view screenshot](/assets/images/details-related-screenshot.jpg "detailed view screenshot")
* Contribute to the Marketplace by suggesting new content or enriching existing items. See the Contribute pages for all the details.
* Re-use the SSH Open Marketplace content using the Application programming
  Interface (API). See the API documentation in the
  ["technical aspects" section](/about/implementation), if you want to know
  more.
