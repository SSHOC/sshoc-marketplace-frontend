title: What is the SSH Open Marketplace?
---
The Social Sciences and Humanities Open Marketplace, built as part of the
[Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud project (SSHOC)](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/),
is a discovery portal which pools and contextualises resources for Social
Sciences and Humanities research communities: tools, services, training
materials, datasets and workflows. The Marketplace highlights and showcases
solutions and research practices for every step of the SSH research data life
cycle.

*The SSH Open Marketplace is currently under development. You are currently
visiting the beta version released in December 2020. The final release is
scheduled for December 2021.*

## Key aspects

* **Curation** – This portal thrives on a curation process that makes it easy to
  discover the most appropriate results for each request, so that researchers
  can discover the best resources for the digital aspects of their work. The
  curation process relies on three components: automatic ingest and update of
  data sources; continuous curation of the information by the editorial team and
  – most important – contributions from users, the SSH research community.
* **Community** – The content available in the SSH Open Marketplace and its
  contextualisation is the result of collaborative work that is characterised by
  a user-centric approach. Features that allow contributions, feedback and
  comments are implemented – or will be soon – to ensure that the portal mirrors
  real research practices.
* **Contextualisation** – The portal puts all items into context: each solution
  suggested is linked to other related resources (e.g. a tutorial showing how to
  use a tool, a tool used in a workflow, a publication presenting research
  results produced using a given service). This contextualisation enhances the
  usefulness of the SSH Open Marketplace and ensures users  receive the maximum
  possible benefit from all its contents.

## A Thematic Contribution to the European Open Science Cloud

### SSHOC & EOSC

SSHOC is one of the activities foreseen under INFRAEOSC 04-2018, which supports
the integration and consolidation of thematic e-infrastructure platforms in
preparation for connecting them to the
[European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://sshopencloud.eu/sshoc-eosc). The
overall objective of the SSHOC project is to realise the Social Sciences and
Humanities part of EOSC.

As a domain-oriented discovery portal and the aggregator of the SSHOC project,
the SSH Open Marketplace, contributes directly to the EOSC, supplementing 
existing services such as the EOSC Catalogue & Marketplace, and  facilitating
the fluid exchange of tools, services, data,and knowledge.

### Lifting the SSH Open Marketplace into the Cloud

The SSH Open Marketplace will be fully integrated in the EOSC landscape, for
example by using EOSC Core services, such as the Federated Identity (AAI)
services or the EOSC helpdesk. A SSHOC task force is working on means to
harmonise views on common themes and foster contact with other European and
international organisations operating in the EOSC environment. Specific
attention will be paid to the integration of the Marketplace with other EOSC
catalogues and/ or marketplace(s). In addition, theSSH Open Marketplace will
benefit from  the recommendations and outputs of
[SSHOC WP3](https://sshopencloud.eu/publications/deliverables?field_wp_tid%5B%5D=14),
"Lifting Technologies and Services into the SSH Cloud" led by SSHOC partner
CLARIN.

### ERIC Contributions

In the current governance scheme, 5 ERICs will ensure the continuity of the  SSH
Open Marketplace beyond the lifetime of the SSHOC project.
