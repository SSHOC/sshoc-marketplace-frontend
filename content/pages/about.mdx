title: What is the SSH Open Marketplace?
---

The Social Sciences and Humanities Open Marketplace, built as part of the
[Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud project (SSHOC)](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/),
is a discovery portal which pools and contextualises resources for Social
Sciences and Humanities research communities: tools, services, training
materials, datasets and workflows. The Marketplace highlights and showcases
solutions and research practices for every step of the SSH research data life
cycle.

## Key aspects

- **Curation** – This portal thrives on a curation process that makes it easy to
  discover the most appropriate results for each request, so that researchers
  can discover the best resources for the digital aspects of their work. The
  curation process relies on three components: automatic ingest and update of
  data sources; continuous curation of the information by the editorial team and
  – most important – contributions from its users, the SSH research community.
- **Community** – The content available in the SSH Open Marketplace and its
  contextualisation is the result of collaborative work that is characterised by
  a user-centric view. Features that allow contributions, feedback and comments
  are implemented – or will be soon – to ensure that the portal mirrors real
  research practices.
- **Contextualisation** – The portal puts all items into context: each solution
  suggested is linked to other related resources (e.g. a tutorial showing how to
  use a tool, a tool used in a workflow, a publication presenting research
  results produced using a given service). This contextualisation reinforces
  serendipity and helps users to reuse the content of the SSH Open Marketplace.

## A thematic contribution to the European Open Science Cloud

### SSHOC & EOSC

SSHOC is one of the activities foreseen under INFRAEOSC 04-2018, which supports
the integration and consolidation of thematic e-infrastructure platforms in
preparation for connecting them to the
[European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://sshopencloud.eu/sshoc-eosc). The
overall objective of the SSHOC project is to realise the Social Sciences and
Humanities part of EOSC.

The SSH Open Marketplace, the discovery portal and aggregator of the SSHOC
project, is a direct contribution to EOSC. As a domain oriented portal, the SSH
Open Marketplace supplements the existing services offered by EOSC (e.g. EOSC
Catalogue & Marketplace) and aims to facilitate fluid exchange of tools,
services, data and knowledge.

## In development

The development of the portal takes place within Work Package 7 (WP7) of the
larger SSHOC project and is led by the DARIAH ERIC.

Three releases of this website are planed between June 2020 and December 2021:

- **June 2020**: alpha version of the website is available for testers
- **December 2020**: beta and public release
- **December 2021**: final release of the SSH Open Marketplace

If you are interested in contributing to the SSH Open Marketplace, join our
testers' team, you can register
[here](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/form/ssh-open-marketplace-join-community-testers/),
or check our public consultation where we gather users' feedback (available soon
on the [SSHOC website](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/)).

And if you want to actively follow the development of the SSH Open Marketplace,
