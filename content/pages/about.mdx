title: What is the SSH Open Marketplace?
---
The Social Sciences and Humanities Open Marketplace, built as part of the
[Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud project (SSHOC)](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/),
is a discovery portal which pools and contextualises resources for Social
Sciences and Humanities research communities: tools, services, training
materials, datasets and workflows. The Marketplace highlights and showcases
solutions and research practices for every step of the SSH research data life
cycle.

The SSH Open Marketplace is currently under development.  The final release is scheduled for December 2021.

## Key aspects

* **Curation** – This portal thrives on a curation process that makes it easy to
  discover the most appropriate results for each request, so that researchers
  can discover the best resources for the digital aspects of their work. The
  curation process relies on three components: automatic ingest and update of
  data sources; continuous curation of the information by the editorial team and
  – most important – contributions from its users, the SSH research community.
* **Community** – The content available in the SSH Open Marketplace and its
  contextualisation is the result of collaborative work that is characterised by
  a user-centric view. Features that allow contributions, feedback and comments
  are implemented – or will be soon – to ensure that the portal mirrors real
  research practices.
* **Contextualisation** – The portal puts all items into context: each solution
  suggested is linked to other related resources (e.g. a tutorial showing how to
  use a tool, a tool used in a workflow, a publication presenting research
  results produced using a given service). This contextualisation reinforces
  serendipity and helps users to reuse the content of the SSH Open Marketplace.

## A thematic contribution to the European Open Science Cloud

### SSHOC & EOSC

SSHOC is one of the activities foreseen under INFRAEOSC 04-2018, which supports
the integration and consolidation of thematic e-infrastructure platforms in
preparation for connecting them to the
[European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://sshopencloud.eu/sshoc-eosc). The
overall objective of the SSHOC project is to realise the Social Sciences and
Humanities part of EOSC.

The SSH Open Marketplace, the discovery portal and aggregator of the SSHOC
project, is a direct contribution to EOSC. As a domain oriented portal, the SSH
Open Marketplace supplements the existing services offered by EOSC (e.g. EOSC
Catalogue & Marketplace) and aims to facilitate fluid exchange of tools,
services, data and knowledge.

### Lifting the SSH Open Marketplace into the Cloud

The SSH Open Marketplace will be fully integrated in the EOSC landscape, for example by using EOSC Core services, such as the Federated Identity (AAI) services or the EOSC helpdesk. A SSHOC task force is working on means to harmonize views on common themes and foster contact with other European and international organizations operating in the EOSC environment. Specific attention will be paid to the integration of the Marketplace with other EOSC catalogues and/ or marketplace(s). Beyond this task force, the SSH Open Marketplace is built following recommendations and outputs of [SSHOC WP3](https://sshopencloud.eu/publications/deliverables?field_wp_tid%5B%5D=14), led by CLARIN, that aims at “Lifting Technologies and Services into the SSH Cloud”.

### ERICs contributions

In the current governance scheme, 5 ERICs are foreseen to contribute to the SSH Open Marketplace sustainability after the SSHOC project.
