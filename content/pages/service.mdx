## Content and sources

During the development phase of the MP, **sources** where to collect information
and populate the SSH Open Marketplace have been identified and prioritised. In
an initial onboarding phase (Jan-Jun 2020), 1,500 individual resources coming
from TAPoR, Programming Historian and the Standardization Survival Kit (SSK)
have been ingested. The extended population phase (Jun 2020-Dec2020) will be
based on the following sources: CLARIN/SSHOC Switchboard, DH Conference papers,
EOSC portal marketplace, CESSDA Data Catalogue, CLARIN VLO, CLARIN resource
families, METHODICA, TERESAH.

Resources and content collected in the above-mentioned sources are - for the
time being - organised through 5 main types in the SSH Open Marketplace: (1)
tools (software and services), (2) training materials, (3) workflows, (4)
datasets and (5) research papers.

- **Source** – A third-party catalogue, containing information about items of
  interest relevant in the scope of the Marketplace, which is ingested as a
  whole in the SSH Open Marketplace. One example: TAPoR, a gateway to the tools
  used in sophisticated text analysis and retrieval helped us to populate the
  SSH Open Marketplace with 1371 tools.
- A **resource** or an **item** – These represent the actual content level, i.e.
  individual entries in the SSH Open Marketplace, representing individual tools,
  services, training materials or workflows. For instance: Voyant Tools, a text
  analysis tool listed in TAPoR.

## Curation of the SSH Open Marketplace

### Curation criteria

The first criteria on which the selection of content is based are:

- **SSH scope** – relating to whether a resource is pertinent in terms of its
  "SSH disciplines" scope.
- **Used in research communities** – relating to whether a resource is (widely)
  used in a given research community. In the SSH Open Marketplace, the
  contextualisation of an item and its relation with others, as well as some
  "community features" ensure we answer this criteria.
- **Up-to-date/maintained** – relating to the need to provide up-to-date
  resources, thus to identify possible outdated ones.
- **Openness** – resources showcased in the SSH Open Marketplace facilitate the
  uptake of Open Science workflows and open research practices and preferably
  are themselves built on open source solutions and/or published in open
  formats.

During the next months, this list will be enriched and improved.

### Community curation

As a curator, you will be, from December 2020 onwards, able to suggest new
content in the SSH Open Marketplace, but also to propose changes to existing
items.

As a moderator, you could become a dedicated member of the SSH Open
Marketplace's editorial board.

## EOSC integration

The SSH Open Marketplace will be fully integrated in the EOSC landscape, for
example by using EOSC Core services, such as the Federated Identity (AAI)
services or the EOSC helpdesk. A SSHOC task force is working on means to
harmonize views on common themes and foster contact with other European and
international organizations operating in the EOSC environment. Specific
attention will be paid to the integration of the marketplace with other EOSC
catalogues and/ or marketplace(s). Beyond this task force we also rely for the
interoperability issues on the
[SSHOC Data and Metadata Interoperability Hub](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/news/mapping-metadata-interoperability-problems-building-sshoc-interoperability-hub/).
