title: About the data population

## Sources

During the development phase of the SSH Open Marketplace, we identified and
prioritised trusted sources from which to gather information to populate the SSH
Open Marketplace. In an initial onboarding phase (first half of 2020), 1,500
individual resources – tools and services, training materials and workflows -
were ingested.  After an extended population phase (second half of 2020), the
Beta version of the Marketplace now includes over 5,000 individual items. The
sources are listed below.

[TAPoR](http://tapor.ca/home) is a long-standing gateway to tools used for text
analysis and retrieval.

![Programming Historian logo](/assets/images/ph-en.svg "Programming Historian logo")

The [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) publishes
novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range
of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate research and teaching.

![Standardization Survival Kit logo](/assets/images/source_ssk_logo.svg "Standardization Survival Kit logo")

The [Standardisation Survival Kit](http://ssk.huma-num.fr/#/) presents a
collection of research use case scenarios illustrating best practices in Digital
Humanities and Heritage research.

![Language Resource Switchboard logo](/assets/images/source-icon-services-switchboard.png)

The [Language Resource Switchboard](https://switchboard.clarin.eu/) helps you
find tools that can process your data.

![dblp computer science bibliography logo](/assets/images/source_dblp_logo_320x120.png "dblp computer science bibliography logo")

The [dblp computer science bibliography](https://dblp.org/) provides open
bibliographic information on major computer science journals and
proceedings. Only a subset of publications related to digital humanities is
being ingested in the SSH Open Marketplace.

![EOSC logo](/assets/images/source_eosc_logo.png "EOSC logo")

The [EOSC Portal catalogue & marketplace](https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/)
is an integrated platform that allows easy access to plenty of services and
resources for various research domains along with integrated data analytics
tools. Only a subset of resources, relevant for Social Sciences and Humanities,
is being ingested in the SSH Open Marketplace.

During the course of 2021, linguistic, social sciences, and cultural heritage
sources will be added. Manual and individual additions of content will also be
possible (see "How to contribute" below).

## Types of content

The conceptual approach used to structure and classify the content of the SSH
Open Marketplace led to the identification of 5 main content types.

<div className="grid" style={{ gridTemplateColumns: '60px 1fr', columnGap: '1rem' }}>

![Tool or service](/assets/images/categories/tool-or-service.svg "Tool or service logo")

<div>

### Tools & services

Materials or products used to perform activities such as:

* Desktop clients solutions (to be installed locally)
* Browser-based or command-line based resources
* Mobile apps
* Programming libraries or APIs
* Data catalogues

*Example:* Gephi is a visualisation and exploration software for all kinds of
graphs and networks.

<div className="grid" style={{ gridTemplateColumns: '60px 1fr', columnGap: '1rem' }}>

![Training Material](/assets/images/categories/training-material.svg "Training Material")

<div>

### Training materials

Tutorials, lessons or didactic resources explaining how to perform an action or
highlighting the learning outcomes one would gain from engaging with the
material.

*Example:* The lesson "Beginner's Guide to Twitter Data" (Programming Historian
website).

<div className="grid" style={{ gridTemplateColumns: '60px 1fr', columnGap: '1rem' }}>

![Workflow](/assets/images/categories/workflow.svg "Workflow logo")

<div>

### Workflows

Sequences of operation/steps performed on research data during their lifecycle.
Workflows can be achieved by using diverse tools and facilities, and useful
resources are connected to each step.

*Example:* "Extract textual content from images" is a workflow composed of 13
steps coming from the Standardization Survival Kit.

<div className="grid" style={{ gridTemplateColumns: '60px 1fr', columnGap: '1rem' }}>

![Dataset](/assets/images/categories/dataset.svg "Dataset logo")

<div>

### Datasets

Single digital objects or collections of data, records, or information that is
kept as a persistent unit of information  in  the  knowledge  generation 
process.  Datasets  are  used  as  evidence  for  some phenomena.

*Example:* Parlamint 1.0

<div className="grid" style={{ gridTemplateColumns: '60px 1fr', columnGap: '1rem' }}>

![Publication](/assets/images/categories/publication.svg "Publication logo")

<div>

### Publications

Research results published in academic journals or repositories. The SSH Open
Marketplace references only publications that can be connected to other
resources and is not an exhaustive collection of papers.

*Example:* "PoetryLab. An Open Source Toolkit for the Analysis of Spanish Poetry
Corpora" is a Conference Paper presented during the DH2020 Conference in which
you can find an example of use of the SpaCy library (referenced as a tool in the
SSH Open Marketplace).

## Inclusion crietria

Because we believe that accurate and up-to-date content is key to making the SSH
Open Marketplace a rich and useful discovery portal, data population and
curation are at the heart of our work. Once (meta)data have been ingested in the
Marketplace, we curate and enrich them thanks to a hybrid approach: automatic
checks are run on the ingested data, followed by manual review of the identified
problems as well as of aspects that cannot be checked automatically. In this
process, contributors and moderators are playing an essential role (See "How to
contribute" below).

Currently the curation criteria fall into three categories.

1. **Scientific**

   The broad scope of the SSH Open Marketplace means that to be selected, any
   resource must fulfill at least two criteria:

   * Relevance for science and scientists
   * Pertinence to the digital methodologies used within the SSH landscape

   Selection decisions are made by  Moderators. Particularly for resources such
   as technical services or software, the SSH link could be very loose. In such
   cases the relevance may be assessed in terms of the uptake or prominence of a
   resource within the SSH community.
2. **Technical**

   Ideally, two technical curation criteria should be met by any resource:

   * Current and supported
   * Open

   The SSH Open Marketplace favours the uptake of Open Science workflows and
   open research practices. Software resources are preferably built upon open
   source solutions.

   Note: Given that the SSH Open Marketplace seeks to  mirror actual research
   practices, commercial or non-current resources are also referenced where
   these are relevant for the scientific community.
3. **Legal/Ethical**

   By design, the SSH Open Marketplace maximises the findability and re-use of
   data in line with the **FAIR principles** – Findable, Accessible,
   Interoperable and Re-usable – for research data, and guides users towards
   tools, services or training materials that can help them in their
   FAIRification workflows.

   Of necessity, the SSH Open Marketplace is  GDPR compliant . This is reflected
   in the manner of presentation of the resources and – more obviously – in the
   management of users.

During the course of  2021, **Editorial Guidelines** will be added to this page.
