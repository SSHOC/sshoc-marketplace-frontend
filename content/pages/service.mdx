# Sources

During the development phase of the SSH Open Marketplace, we identified and prioritised trusted sources from which we gather information to populate the SSH Open Marketplace. In an initial onboarding phase (first half of 2020), 1,500 we ingested individual resources – tools and services, training materials and workflows. Thanks to an extended population phase (second half of 2020), the beta version of the Marketplace now includes over 5,000 individual items, coming from the following sources:

[TAPoR](http://tapor.ca/home) is a long-standing gateway to tools used for text analysis and retrieval.

![](/assets/images/ph-en.svg "Programming Historian logo")

The [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) publishes novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate research and teaching.

The [Standardisation Survival Kit](http://ssk.huma-num.fr/#/) presents a collection of research use case scenarios illustrating best practices in Digital Humanities and Heritage research.

The [Language Resource Switchboard](https://switchboard.clarin.eu/) helps you find tools that can process your data.

![](/assets/images/source_dblp_logo_320x120.png "dblp computer science bibliography logo")

The [dblp computer science bibliography](https://dblp.org/) provides open bibliographic information on major computer science journals and proceedings. Only a subset of publications related to digital humanities is being ingested in the SSH Open Marketplace.

![](/assets/images/source_eosc_logo.png "EOSC logo")

The [EOSC Portal catalogue & marketplace](https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/) is an integrated platform that allows easy access to plenty of services and resources for various research domains along with integrated data analytics tools. Only a subset of resources, relevant for Social Sciences and Humanities, is being ingested in the SSH Open Marketplace.

Linguistic, social sciences and cultural heritage sources will be added in 2021. Manual and individual additions of content is also a way to further populate the SSH Open Marketplace. More details are provided in the “How is this website curated?” section below.

# Types of content

The conceptual approach used to structure and classify the SSH Open Marketplace content led to the identification of 5 main types of content:

![](/assets/images/categories/tool-or-service.svg "Tool or service logo")

**Tools & services**
Tools & services are materials or products used to perform activities. Under this type of item, SSH Open Marketplace users will find desktop clients solutions (to be installed locally), browser-based or command-line based resources, mobile apps, programming libraries or APIs, but also data catalogues.
Example: Gephi is a visualisation and exploration software for all kinds of graphs and networks

![](/assets/images/categories/training-material.svg "Training Materials logo")

**Training materials**
Tutorials, lessons or didactic resources explaining how to perform an action or highlighting the learning outcomes one would gain from engaging with the material.
Example: The lesson “Beginner's Guide to Twitter Data” coming from the Programming Historian website.

![](/assets/images/categories/workflows.svg "Workflows logo")

**Workflows**
A research workflow is a sequence of operation/steps performed on research data during their lifecycle. It can be seen as a recipe, as it was “designed” in the Standardisation Survival Kit. This workflow can be achieved by using diverse tools and facilities, and useful resources are connected to each step.
Example: “Extract textual content from images” is a workflow composed of 13 steps coming from the Standardization Survival Kit.

**Datasets**
Dataset is one digital object or a set or collection of data, records or information that is kept as a persistent unit of information  in  the  knowledge  generation  process.  Datasets  are  used  as  evidence  for  some phenomena.
Example: Parlamint 1.0

![](/assets/images/categories/publication.svg "Publications logo")

**Publications**
Research results published in an academic journal or repository. In the SSH Open Marketplace, only publications that can be connected to other resources are referenced. We don’t aim at collecting all the research papers in SSH, but only to reinforce the contextualisation of our resources, offering perspectives in which a tool has been used and cited in a paper for exemple.
Example: “PoetryLab. An Open Source Toolkit for the Analysis of Spanish Poetry Corpora” is a Conference Paper presented during the DH2020 Conference in which you can find an example of use of the SpaCy library (referenced as a tool in the SSH Open Marketplace).
