# Content and sources

During the development phase of the SSH Open Marketplace, we identified and prioritised trusted sources from which we gather information to populate the SSH Open Marketplace. In an initial onboarding phase (first half of 2020), 1,500 we ingested individual resources – tools and services, training materials and workflows. Thanks to an extended population phase (second half of 2020), the beta version of the Marketplace now includes over 5,000 individual items, coming from the following sources:

[TAPoR](http://tapor.ca/home) is a long-standing gateway to tools used for text analysis and retrieval.

The [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) publishes novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate research and teaching.

The [Standardisation Survival Kit](http://ssk.huma-num.fr/#/) presents a collection of research use case scenarios illustrating best practices in Digital Humanities and Heritage research.

The [Language Resource Switchboard](https://switchboard.clarin.eu/) helps you find tools that can process your data.

The [dblp computer science bibliography](https://dblp.org/) provides open bibliographic information on major computer science journals and proceedings. Only a subset of publications related to digital humanities is being ingested in the SSH Open Marketplace.

The [EOSC Portal catalogue & marketplace](https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/) is an integrated platform that allows easy access to plenty of services and resources for various research domains along with integrated data analytics tools. Only a subset of resources, relevant for Social Sciences and Humanities, is being ingested in the SSH Open Marketplace.



Linguistic, social sciences and cultural heritage sources will be added in 2021. Manual and individual additions of content is also a way to further populate the SSH Open Marketplace. More details are provided in the “How is this website curated?” section below.

# Types of content

The conceptual approach used to structure and classify the SSH Open Marketplace content led to the identification of 5 main types of content:

Resources and content collected in the above-mentioned sources are - for the
time being - organised through 5 main types in the SSH Open Marketplace: (1)
tools (software and services), (2) training materials, (3) workflows, (4)
datasets and (5) research papers.

* **Source** – A third-party catalogue, containing information about items of
  interest relevant in the scope of the Marketplace, which is ingested as a
  whole in the SSH Open Marketplace. One example: TAPoR, a gateway to the tools
  used in sophisticated text analysis and retrieval helped us to populate the
  SSH Open Marketplace with 1371 tools.
* A **resource** or an **item** – These represent the actual content level, i.e.
  individual entries in the SSH Open Marketplace, representing individual tools,
  services, training materials or workflows. For instance: Voyant Tools, a text
  analysis tool listed in TAPoR.

## Curation of the SSH Open Marketplace

### Curation criteria

The first criteria on which the selection of content is based are:

* **SSH scope** – relating to whether a resource is pertinent in terms of its
  "SSH disciplines" scope.
* **Used in research communities** – relating to whether a resource is (widely)
  used in a given research community. In the SSH Open Marketplace, the
  contextualisation of an item and its relation with others, as well as some
  "community features" ensure we answer this criteria.
* **Up-to-date/maintained** – relating to the need to provide up-to-date
  resources, thus to identify possible outdated ones.
* **Openness** – resources showcased in the SSH Open Marketplace facilitate the
  uptake of Open Science workflows and open research practices and preferably
  are themselves built on open source solutions and/or published in open
  formats.

During the next months, this list will be enriched and improved.

### Community curation

As a curator, you will be, from December 2020 onwards, able to suggest new
content in the SSH Open Marketplace, but also to propose changes to existing
items.

As a moderator, you could become a dedicated member of the SSH Open
Marketplace's editorial board.

## EOSC integration

The SSH Open Marketplace will be fully integrated in the EOSC landscape, for
example by using EOSC Core services, such as the Federated Identity (AAI)
services or the EOSC helpdesk. A SSHOC task force is working on means to
harmonize views on common themes and foster contact with other European and
international organizations operating in the EOSC environment. Specific
attention will be paid to the integration of the marketplace with other EOSC
catalogues and/ or marketplace(s). Beyond this task force we also rely for the
interoperability issues on the
[SSHOC Data and Metadata Interoperability Hub](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/news/mapping-metadata-interoperability-problems-building-sshoc-interoperability-hub/).
