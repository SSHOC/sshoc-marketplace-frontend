title: The team behind the Marketplace

## How is the website maintained?

Developed within SSHOC, the SSH Open Marketplace will be sustained after the end
of the project (in April 2022). At the moment of the Alpha release, five
European Research Infrastructures Consortia (ERIC) members of the SSHOC
project - DARIAH, CLARIN, CESSDA, ESS and SHARE -, agreed to sustain the SSH
Open Marketplace for a first period of one year after the project.

Discussions are ongoing to understand which business model will be adopted and
how responsibilities will be shared among partners in the long run.
