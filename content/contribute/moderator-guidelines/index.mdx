The Moderation of the SSH Open Marketplace can be considered in two ways, the first being the **moderation and approval** of newly submitted items, and the second being the **sustained curation and assurance of data quality** for already-existing items in the Marketplace.

Once logged in to the SSH Open Marketplace, moderators can perform their editorial tasks via the "My account" dashboard, and especially via the "My items to moderate" section.

## Moderating suggested items

The approval of new Marketplace items revolves around ensuring that the suggested items are up to the standards of the Marketplace described in the guidelines. At a minimum, this means ensuring that all required fields are properly filled out in a standard way and that they are relevant to the source material.

Suggested items should be evaluated based on the quality criteria described in the "Inclusion criteria" section. As well, Moderators should make sure that metadata fields are as fully described as possible, especially those that are recommended. See [metadata guidelines](/contribute/metadata-guidelines) section.

### Suggested items by contributors

1. By selecting the "suggested" status only in the list of items to moderate, moderators can see the list of items waiting for approval/rejection.

   </Figure>
2. By clicking on the "Edit" button, a moderator can access the edit form of a suggested item and check the metadata
3. Approve or reject a suggested version of an item.
   * Approving: makes the suggested version "approved",
   * Rejecting: makes the suggested version rejected and the last approved version remains "approved". (If this was a newly suggested item, it will become deprecated and won't be visible to normal users at all).

### Suggested items by system importer (= via the ingest pipeline)

Though not an everyday occurrence, at times Moderators will, in concert with the SSH Open Marketplace Administrators, choose and approve newly-ingested materials. In such cases, moderators will have to firstly assess the quality and pertinence of the data source before its ingestion and once this is complete, perform "mass validation" of (meta)data before the Marketplace population. See Ingest pipeline workflow in the [Administrator Guidelines](/contribute/administrator-guidelines) for more details.

## Continuously improving (meta)data quality

The continued control of existing Marketplace items revolves around ensuring that the information is still valid and up to date, as well as encouraging the enrichment of items by adding properties that are recommended. Moderators complete these tasks with both automatic and manual checks.

**Quality criteria for SSH Open Marketplace items**

1. **General Entry Requirements**: research requirements, technical aspects, contextualisation and legal/ethical requirements are considered here.
2. **Non-redundancy**: the same entity should only be referenced once in the SSH Open Marketplace. Duplicate items are merged to ensure the coherence of the items showcased in the portal.
3. **Completeness of item description**. This criterion concerns the number of metadata filled out to describe an item and answer to the question of how an entity is described comprehensively.
4. **Verification of conformity and relevance** of metadata. Information value checks depend on the type of content expected.

* if a verbose description is expected, quality criteria revolves around correctness, understandability and concision (i.e. length),
* while for URLs based fields, the quality criteria relate to the link accessibility.
* In order to support discoverability of the Marketplace content, a lot of fields are also (re)using controlled vocabularies, thus the validation checks of vocabulary concepts is also supported by the Marketplace.
* Quality of the media objects is yet another dimension, e.g. ensuring a good picture quality.

5. **Interlinking**. To ensure serendipity and reinforce the browsing experience of the Marketplace, the quality of the links between items is an important criterion. The number of related items for a given entry, and the pertinence of the links are some of the checks performed to ensure that this criterion is met (e.g. whether the link goes to a resource internal or external to the Marketplace).

Based on the quality criteria defined above, some quality metrics have been established (e.g. media quality for images or number of characters in a description) and are automatically checked. These checks are run via a series of Python notebooks. Results of the checks are recorded in a set of metadata specially created for curation purposes - the curation flags - and only visible for moderators.

Nevertheless, because we should never trust a computer (!), moderators should, every few months, do a random selection of pre-existing and non-flagged entries to ensure that these are up to Marketplace quality criteria, as described above.

### Curation flags

These fields are hidden from users and contributors but are available for logged in moderators. The "curation-" metadata are informed by the curation notebooks and can be used to filter the "items to moderate" in the dashboard. As well, when examining a flagged entry, Moderators should briefly look over the other metadata fields to ensure that they are correct.

| Field's name              | Quality checks: what moderators should know                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| curation-detail           | hidden property of type string that contains all curation issues in a human readable structured format. For example, this field describes when the curation-flag-url is TRUE where the url has problems and the http status code as a json, e.g. `{"AccessibleAt": "404"}` |
| curation-flag-url         | hidden property of type boolean, is "TRUE" when an error on at least one of the URL-based fields of an item has been identified                                                                                                                                            |
| curation-flag-description | hidden property of type boolean, is "TRUE" when there is a problem with the description of an item (for example when the description is "no description provided" and should be changed).                                                                                  |
| curation-flag-coverage    | hidden property of type boolean, is "TRUE" when coverage ratio of recommended properties is lesser as expected                                                                                                                                                             |
| curation-flag-relations   | hidden property of type boolean, is "TRUE" when the contextualisation quality is low (based on interlinked items)                                                                                                                                                          |
| curation-flag-merged      | hidden property, marks an item that is the result of a merge command and should be curated                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Python notebooks

In order to gain an overview of the SSH Open Marketplace data and to perform some analysis to prioritise the curation tasks and improve the Marketplace data quality, [a Python library and a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/SSHOC/marketplace-curation) have been created by Cesare Concordia (CNR). These flexible scripts allow moderators and administrators to query the SSH Open Marketplace with advanced parameters and filters and, in some cases, to write back to the system to flag some items for curation in the editorial dashboard.

A dedicated Python library and a set of notebooks are available. For some of the notebooks, specific authorisations (=credentials) are needed.

1. Ingest review notebook (to be developed)
2. Data analysis notebook including some Items provenance analysis, providing a non-redundancy overview, performing some completeness checks (overview of null values; description length), and checking the detailed coverage of given fields.
3. Automatic checks notebooks = curation-flags.

* 3.1 curation-flag-URL
* 3.2 curation-flag-description
* 3.3 Curation-flag-relations (to be completed)
* 3.4 curation-flag-coverage

4. Mass analysis and/or corrections notebooks

* 4.1 Duplicates & merging
* 4.2 Actors curation
* 4.3 Vocabulary management (to be developed)

### Vocabulary management

Some of the metadata fields used in the Marketplace are [using (controlled) vocabularies](/contribute/moderator-guidelines#vocabulary-management), meaning that contributors can select concepts among a pre-existing list. For some fields this list is open and new terms can be added (i.e. keywords) if they don't appear yet, for some others no new concepts can be added (i.e activity is using the TaDIRAH taxonomy that is developed and maintained outside of the Marketplace).

One of the central roles the moderators have is vocabulary management in the SSH Open Marketplace: they are responsible for the vocabularies coherence and update. When a contributor suggests a new concept to a vocabulary, a moderator should decide, if the new term indeed represents a new concept, or if it is just a different lexical representation (alternative label) for an existing concept, or even if the term should not become part of vocabulary for given field at all and should be discarded.

While the functionality for basic curation of the vocabularies is integrated as part of the curation dashboard, it remains possible to effect major vocabulary management changes. The chosen vocabulary can be exported in SKOS format, imported into a separate vocabulary management tool, where the curation is performed and the new version of the vocabulary is again exported in SKOS and reimported into MP via the API. Similarly, if there is an update of the closed (external) vocabularies introduced by the authorities managing these vocabularies, this new version can be introduced to MP via SKOS import. This specific curation task will be further described in a dedicated vocabulary curation notebook.

### Actors management

Moderators ensure the consistency of the actors' database and a specific notebook can help to identify the main issues (duplication of actors, wrong URLs or disambiguation of names and affiliations are the most frequent issues). Because any contributor can enrich the actor records, regular checks should be performed by moderators to continuously ensure the quality of the Marketplace actors.
