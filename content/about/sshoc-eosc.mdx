The creation of the SSH Open Marketplace was funded by the
[Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud (SSHOC) project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/823782)
which supported the integration and consolidation of thematic e-infrastructure platforms in
preparation for connecting them to the
[European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://sshopencloud.eu/sshoc-eosc). The overall objective of
the SSHOC project was to realise the Social Sciences and Humanities part of EOSC.

As a domain-oriented discovery portal and the aggregator of the SSHOC project, the SSH Open
Marketplace, contributes directly to the EOSC, supplementing existing services such as the EOSC
Catalogue & Marketplace, and facilitating the fluid exchange of tools, services, data, and
knowledge.

As a continuation of the SSHOC project and to sustain its outputs, 5 ESFRI Landmarks CESSDA, CLARIN, DARIAH, ESS and SHARE have been signing a [Memorandum of Understanding for the establishment of the SSH Open Cluster](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/news/sshoc-signs-mou-bolster-cloud-services-social-science-and-humanities). This cluster acts as an umbrella for the SSH Open Marketplace organisation and activities.

## Three pillars for the development and functioning of the SSH Open Marketplace

While planning the SSH Open Marketplace during the SSHOC project, we identified three pillars on which we built the Marketplace and which have remained essential for its current functioning and future development. These pillars are:

- **Curation** – This portal thrives on a curation process that makes it easy to discover the most
  appropriate results for each request, so that researchers can discover the best resources for the
  digital aspects of their work. The curation process relies on three components: automatic ingest
  and update of data sources; continuous curation of the information by the editorial team and –
  most important – contributions from users, the SSH research community.
- **Community** – The content available in the SSH Open Marketplace and its contextualisation is the
  result of collaborative work that is characterised by a user-centric approach. Features that allow
  contributions, feedback and comments are implemented – or will be soon – to ensure that the portal
  mirrors real research practices.
- **Contextualisation** – The portal puts all items into context: each solution suggested is linked
  to other related resources (e.g. a tutorial showing how to use a tool, a tool used in a workflow,
  a publication presenting research results produced using a given service). This contextualisation
  enhances the usefulness of the SSH Open Marketplace and ensures users receive the maximum possible
  benefit from all its contents.
