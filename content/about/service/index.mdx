---
The Social Sciences and Humanities Open Marketplace, built as part of the [Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud project (SSHOC)](https://www.sshopencloud.eu/), is a discovery portal which pools and contextualises resources for Social Sciences and Humanities research communities: **tools, services, training materials, datasets, publications and workflows**. The Marketplace highlights and showcases solutions and research practices for every step of the SSH research data life cycle.

The SSH Open Marketplace is:

* a **discovery portal**, to foster serendipity in digital methods
* an **aggregator** of useful and well curated resources
* a **catalogue**, contextualising resources
* an **entry point in the EOSC** for the Social Sciences and Humanities researchers

The SSH Open Marketplace is *not*:

* a repository. Nothing is hosted in the SSH Open Marketplace. Workflow content type can be hosted, but this is an exception
* a data catalogue. The goal is not to collect all the SSH datasets, but selected datasets are indexed to support the contextualisation (dataset mentioned in a publication or used in a training material for example).
* a commercial Marketplace. There is nothing to sell in the SSH Open Marketplace. Commercial software/services can be referenced.
