## Copyright notice

- **License for source code** – The license for the source code of the SSH Open Marketplace is
  Apache License 2.0. More information about this license can be found
  [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/).
- **License for content** – This website collects its content from various sources with different
  reuse policies. Most of the time, catalogues where metadata were collected presented clear
  licences and you can always find information on sources on every item of our catalogue.

Contributors and Moderators of the SSH Open Marketplace enrich the metadata, add new information and
links to it.

We are currently looking for the best licensing framework to support our model: we aim to ensure
wide distribution and reuse of our data, and to avoid attribution stacking or license stacking, but
we do consider attribution to be an essential information to be provided by data aggregators. This
section of our website will be updated accordingly.

## Data privacy notice

[here](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/oeaw/data-protection/). The contact data published in the context
of the imprint duty may not be used to send promotional or informational material not explicitly
requested. We explicitly disagree with this usage.
