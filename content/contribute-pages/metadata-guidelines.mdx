These guidelines include recommendations on metadata fields to be used while
creating and/or reviewing an item entry in the SSH Open Marketplace.

The first subsection presents the fields that are mandatory and recommended
depending on the type of items you want to create. A second section gives some
explanations about the fields themselves - in case the title is not
self-explanatory - how to fill in a field if you create an item and what you
should check if you are a moderator.

## Metadata status

* **Mandatory** fields are clearly indicated in the edit forms and you won't be
  able to submit an item if these fields are empty
* **Recommended** fields are present by default in the forms, depending on the
  item types you want to create (i.e. if you want to create a publication, all
  the bibliographic metadata are included by default in the edit forms).
* **Optional** fields can be added via the edit forms.
* There are also **hidden** properties that are used by the moderation team in
  the process of curation, and these are only visible to moderators that have
  logged in.

| Actors                            | An Actor is a person or an organisation who contributed in some way to the creation of the linked resource described in the SSH Open Marketplace. Name of an actor is mandatory: while creating an actor, you need at least to add a name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Moderators will ensure the consistency of the actors database (=> dashboard): one actor should only be registered once.                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                                   | Define role as one of: contributor, author, reviewer, director, programmer, editor, provider, contact, funder, helpdesk. By default, the Actor's role is contributor. Add ExternalID for actors: ORCID, recommended. Add ROR IDs for research organisation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | It is recommended that the Actor(s) be identified by an externalID (esp. ORCID). Anything that can help to identify the contributor is recommended                                                                                                                                            |

| Media                             | Media can be images or videos. Some recommendations:  **Images**: 1. Look for freely available screenshots or visualisations of a tool (CC licence or similar). 2. If that doesn't yield good results, look for material available on the original website. 3. Consider making own screenshots. 4. NOTE: You can add the URL of an image, if you choose to upload, image must be 1MB or smaller in size. Format supported: JPG, TIFF, PNG, GIF. **Videos**: 1. If on YouTube or Vimeo: just deliver the URL (title/caption of the video might be retrieved automatically). 2. If elsewhere: provide link to video and descriptive caption. **Media-caption**: every media should include a descriptive caption, i.e verbose information mentioning license and credits about the media used. | Automatic checks will determine presence or not of media (=> dashboard).Moderators will check for coherence of media with linked MP entry.
