These guidelines include recommendations on metadata fields to be used while creating and/or reviewing an item entry in the SSH Open Marketplace. 

The first subsection presents the fields that are mandatory and recommended depending on the type of items you want to create. A second section gives some explanations about the fields themselves - in case the title is not self-explanatory - how to fill in a field if you create an item and what you should check if you are a moderator.

### Metadata status
- **Mandatory** fields are clearly indicated in the edit forms and you won’t be able to submit an item if these fields are empty
- **Recommended** fields are present by default in the forms, depending on the item types you want to create (i.e. if you want to create a publication, all the bibliographic metadata are included by default in the edit forms). 
- **Optional** fields can be added via the edit forms. 
- There are also **hidden** properties that are used by the moderation team in the process of curation, and these are only visible to moderators that have logged in.
